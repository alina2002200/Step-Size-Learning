online_scaled_gradient_methods_(1).py file contains the code for quadratic case. One can play with sigmas etas and random seed to generate better matrices and achieve the results from the report. osgm_h_a1a.ipynb contains the code for the osgm_h method applied to the a1a dataset from libsvm. Upon implementation, and applying different values of eta, convergence speed of osgm_h is compared to that of gradient descent.
